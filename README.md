## Abstract
### *BACKGROUND*
Prevalence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has been increasing in the US during the past decades. The exact mechanisms remain enigmatic and diagnosis of the disease still relies primarily on subjective assessment of behavior.

### *OBJECTIVES*
We aim to identify plasma biomarkers of ASD by comparing the metabolomics profiles between cases and controls and investigate the influence of shared genetic and environmental components on these biomarkers.

### *METHODS* 
We used orthogonal liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry to conduct untargeted analysis of plasma samples and executed a metabolome-wide association study (MWAS) on a sample with 75 cases and 29 controls (mean age of 8.16 and 12.25 years respectively). We also obtained the parental metabolomics profiles of probands in 31 families and investigated the within family correlations of the MWAS significant signals.

### *RESULTS*
We detected a total of 19 184 signals and 191 of them were statistically significant in MWAS including an endogenous metabolite, O-phosphotyrosine (OR 0.17, 95% CIs 0.06-0.39). Spearman’s rank correlations of the significant signals between probands and parents are low (mean: 0.11). We also observed a lack of pattern symmetry in the correlation globes of the proband families. These findings suggest that shared household environment has a weak influence on the ASD associated metabolites.

### *CONCLUSIONS*
Using an untargeted metabolomics platform, we found a number of chemical signals correlated with ASD. The familial correlation analyses suggested that a substantial portion of the unannotated significant signals were likely ASD-specific biomarkers not shared with parents and could have diagnostic value with high specificity.
